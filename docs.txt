name: learn-github-actions
This sets the name of the workflow to "learn-github-actions".
yaml
Copy code
run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is learning GitHub Actions
This dynamically sets the name of the workflow run to the GitHub username of the person triggering the workflow, followed by "is learning GitHub Actions".
yaml
Copy code
on: [push]
This specifies that the workflow should run whenever there is a push event to the repository.
yaml

Learning Notes:
This workflow is triggered by a push event to the repository.
It checks the version of the bats testing framework installed on the runner machine.
It uses the actions/checkout action to fetch the latest code from the repository.
It sets up Node.js with version 14 using the actions/setup-node action.
It installs the bats testing framework globally using npm.
It then verifies the installed bats version by running the bats -v command.
Usages:
This workflow can be used as a learning tool to understand how GitHub Actions workflows are structured and how actions are used within them.
It demonstrates how to set up Node.js and install dependencies using GitHub Actions.
It shows how to run commands and scripts within a workflow to perform various tasks, such as installing software and checking versions.
